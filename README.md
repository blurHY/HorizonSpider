The ZeroNet spider for Horizon Search Engine (Still in development)

This spider uses websocket to communicate with zeronet and crawls zites using the APIs.
So it's much more efficient than before.

## Getting started

Install ZeroNet first,then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blurHY/HorizonSpider
cd HorizonSpider
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 HorizonSpider.py
```

## How does it crawl?
