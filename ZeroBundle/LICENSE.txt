Cryptography Notice
===================
This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted.

Continuum Analytics has self-classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and source code.

The following packages are included in this distribution that relate to cryptography:

openssl
    The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

pycrypto
    A collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.).

pyopenssl
    A thin Python wrapper around (a subset of) the OpenSSL library.

kerberos (krb5, non-Windows platforms)
    A network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.

cryptography
    A Python library which exposes cryptographic recipes and primitives.
